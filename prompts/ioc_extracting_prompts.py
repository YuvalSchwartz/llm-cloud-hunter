Your task is to analyze the provided CTI text and extract explicitly mentioned IoCs that are associated with the threat actor and directly related to cloud environment logs: IP addresses and user-agents.

Important Notes:
1. Focus on the paragraph usually located at the end of the document under a corresponding heading, where IoCs are listed.
2. Ensure that the extracted IoCs match the format (or part of it) found in AWS log records. For example, convert general terms like "AWS Golang SDK" to "aws-sdk-go/".
3. Avoid extracting duplications or redundant versions of the same IoC.
4. Be thorough and ensure that no IoC is missed.'''
